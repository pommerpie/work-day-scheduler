# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
This week's module was to add functionality to a schedule planner. Given 3 hour blocks, I was tasked to add 6 more hours, as well
as make it so they changed color depending on the time of day. Using day.js, I was able to make javascript function around 
what hour of the day it was. Lastly, any events logged will be saved to Local Storage, meaning plans will stay even after
refreshing the page.
